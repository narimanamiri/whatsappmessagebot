# whatsappmessagebot
this script sends whatsapp messages automatically
the script reads a list of phone numbers from a file named `numbers.list` and sends a specific WhatsApp message to each number using the `twilio` library:

```python
from twilio.rest import Client

# Set up Twilio client
account_sid = 'YOUR_ACCOUNT_SID_HERE'
auth_token = 'YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE'
client = Client(account_sid, auth_token)

# Read phone numbers from file
with open('numbers.list', 'r') as f:
    numbers = f.read().splitlines()

# Set message to send
message = 'YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE'

# Loop through phone numbers and send message
for number in numbers:
    message = client.messages.create(
        from_='whatsapp:+14155238886',
        body=message,
        to=f'whatsapp:{number}'
    )
    print(f'Message sent to {number}: {message.sid}')
```

Here's how the script works:

1. The script sets up a Twilio client using the `Client` class from the `twilio.rest` library, and sets the account SID and auth token using the `account_sid` and `auth_token` variables.
2. The script reads the phone numbers from the `numbers.list` file using the `open` function and the `read` method, and splits the lines into a list using the `splitlines` method.
3. The script sets the message to send using the `message` variable.
4. The script loops through each phone number in the `numbers` list, sends the message using the `create` method of the `messages` object of the `Client` object, and prints a message to the console with the phone number and message SID.

Note that this script assumes that you have a Twilio account and have set up a WhatsApp Sandbox. You can obtain your account SID and auth token from the Twilio console, and follow the instructions in the WhatsApp Sandbox to obtain a Twilio phone number and configure the Sandbox with your WhatsApp account. Additionally, note that sending WhatsApp messages using Twilio requires that the recipient has opted in to receive messages from your Twilio phone number and that your Twilio phone number is authorized to send messages to the recipient.
